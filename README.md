## Content
The three startups [Data-Pop Alliance](http://www.datapopalliance.org/), [DataRobot](http://www.datarobot.com/) and [DataLook](http://datalook.io/) are joining forces to advance the field of Big Data for Social Good. In this interactive session you will learn about this emerging and promising field. What has been achieved so far and what is the outlook?

Specifically, the audience will learn about how Big Data for Social Good can be linked with Kaggle, the largest community of data scientists in the world. One of the top ranked data scientists on Kaggle will share his experiences and introduce you to the platform. We will then perform an interactive Kaggle crash course with the audience. Together, we will work with tools that allow for a quick start in iterative data analysis. We will provide downloadable, interactive material that allows you to follow the data analysis and to make your first submission to Kaggle. Bringing a tablet or laptop to the session might be useful. You can prepare for the session by creating user accounts on [kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com/) and [wakari.io](http://wakari.io).
